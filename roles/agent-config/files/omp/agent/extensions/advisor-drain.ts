/**
 * advisor-drain.ts
 *
 * Holds a session busy at turn end until every advisor finishes, so an
 * in-flight vault write (or any other advisor side effect) is not lost when
 * the turn ends and the UI, or the process, moves on.
 *
 * `AgentSession.waitForAdvisorCatchup(timeoutMs)` awaits every advisor's
 * backlog down to zero, plus pending advisor-card persistence. It returns
 * `false` on deadline expiry or advisor failure. There is no public
 * per-advisor busy read, so the drain itself still waits on every advisor,
 * not one by name. The working-message text below only picks a name to
 * display; it does not change which advisors the drain waits for.
 *
 * Live-tested cap: the harness enforces its own hard ceiling on every
 * `turn_end` hook handler, `EXTENSION_HANDLER_TIMEOUT_MS` (30s), with no
 * per-event override. A `timeoutMs` at or above that ceiling never runs to
 * completion: the host aborts the handler at 30s and logs "handler timed
 * out", regardless of the value passed here. `HOOK_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` stays
 * a safety margin under that fixed ceiling.
 *
 * `drainAdvisors` is also called from `end-session.ts`, inside a tool
 * `execute()` call, not a hook handler. That path has no 30s host ceiling,
 * so it passes its own, longer cap.
