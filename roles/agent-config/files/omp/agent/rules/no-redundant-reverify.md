A reviewer or advisor just gave a clean verdict on work you already completed and verified — and you are about to re-verify it. STOP.

- A confirmed-correct verdict is terminal. Re-running tests you already ran, re-reading the same files, re-diffing, or re-spawning the reviewer adds no information and wastes turns.
- "The reviewer approved" is the SAME evidence you already had, now confirmed — not new evidence that warrants another pass.
- Re-verify ONLY if the verdict raised a NEW, concrete concern, or the code changed since your last check. Otherwise: accept the verdict and yield.
