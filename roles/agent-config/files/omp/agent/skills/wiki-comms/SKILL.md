description: Use when the user asks to check Slack, catch up on a channel or thread, search Slack history, or draft and send a Slack message. Also covers a ClearRoute daily or manager update for Teams.
---

## When
- The user asks what happened in a channel or thread.
- The user asks the agent to draft a Slack message or reply.
- Another skill (`wiki-task-loop`) asks you to draft a Slack update.
- The user asks for a "ClearRoute daily" or a manager update for Teams.

## Inputs
- Org pages under `vault://wiki/orgs/` (`slack_channels` field).
- Slack read routes: `xd://mcp__slack_channels_me`, `xd://mcp__slack_channels_list`, `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_history`, `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_replies`, `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_search_messages`, `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_unreads`, `xd://mcp__slack_users_search`.
- Slack write route (gated): `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_add_message`.

## Steps
1. Find the right channel. Read the org page under `vault://wiki/orgs/` (per `vault://wiki/schema.md`) and take its `slack_channels` list. Cross-check against `xd://mcp__slack_channels_me` for channels the agent can reach.
2. Read for context. Use `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_history` for channel activity, `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_replies` for one thread, and `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_search_messages` for a keyword or person search. Use `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_unreads` to catch up on everything unread.
3. Resolve people. Use `xd://mcp__slack_users_search` to match a Slack user to a page under `vault://wiki/people/`. Create or update the person page with the resolved `slack_id`.
4. Write the draft message and name the target channel or thread. Do not call `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_add_message` before the Gate below passes.
5. GATE. Show the exact draft text and the target channel or thread. Wait for explicit approval.
6. After approval, send the approved text, unedited, with `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_add_message`.
7. File a thread with lasting value: a decision, an announcement, or a spec discussion. Create a source page at `vault://wiki/sources/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. Set `type: source`, `origin: slack`, and the thread `url` if one exists. Write a short summary. Link the page from the related project or decision page. Add an entry for the source page to `vault://wiki/index.md`, under the Sources heading.
8. Append the log entry (see `## Log`) to `vault://wiki/log.md`.

## Alternative flow: ClearRoute daily update
Trigger: the user says the message is for the "ClearRoute daily," a manager
update, or a Teams status message, not a Slack channel post.

1. Pull the day's finished work from `vault://wiki/log.md` (the named day's
   entries) plus any PR or ADO ticket numbers those entries name.
2. Draft to the user's confirmed style (set 2026-08-25):
   - Cap the whole message at two sentences.
   - Open with "As for me yesterday:" (swap the day name to match).
   - State outcomes, not process steps. Roll a multi-step outcome into one
     phrase, for example "linked to the ticket and moved to Resolved"
     becomes "ADO tickets are up to date."
   - Drop verification detail (tests run, live-verification) once the work
     sits in an open PR; the PR already implies it.
   - Keep concrete identifiers (bug numbers, PR numbers) in the sentence.
     Drop internal workflow language: ADO state names, tool names, skill
     names.
3. Show the draft and wait for edits or approval before the user sends it.
   This flow has no send step of its own; Teams has no message route here.

## Gates
- Before any call to `xd://mcp__slack_conversations_add_message`: show the exact draft text and the target channel or thread, and wait for approval. Send only the approved text.
